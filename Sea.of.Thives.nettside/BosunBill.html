 <p>Bosun Bill was known throughout the port.<br>
    A truly dreadful pirate who was always getting caught.<br>
    Not one scheme for stealing could he hatch.<br>
    'cause someone would spot,<br>
    the treasure he'd got.<br>
    And Bill they'd snatch!</p><br>
    
   <p>One day Bill awoke lying on a distant beach.<br>
    The last of his grog was just out of reach.<br>
    He groped around with trembling hands.<br>
    And stuck something in the sand!</p><br>
    
   <p> He'd stumbled upon a part.<br>
    Of an ancient chart.<br>
    Stained and torn, the old map told.<br>
    The way to find a stash of buried gold so...</p><br>
    
    <p>Bosun Bill, set out to find a crew.<br>
    But everyone he asked replied "I'll never sail with you!"<br>
    'Til at last, he plied a man with ale.<br>
    To lend him his craft, a rickety raft.<br>
    Then Bill set sail!</p><br>
    
    <p>All by himself, Bill trembled in the dark.<br>
    He lost both his boots and hat to a shark.<br>
    He followed the chart 'til at last he saw.<br>
    The gleam of a far-off shore.</p><br>
    
    <p>The trail led into a cave.<br>
    Silent as the grave.<br>
    Bill stood gaping at what he saw.<br>
    A hoard of treasure piled from roof to floor.</p><br>
    
   <p> Bosun Bill stuffed treasure into his sack.<br>
    He loaded up the boat, but he heard a mighty crack.<br>
    He'd taken to much plunder when he should have kept it light.<br>
    The raft and all the gold sank out of sight.</p><br>
    
    <p>Bosun Bill let out a terrible curse.<br>
    He'd had a chance at glory but he'd only come out worse!<br>
    To this day, he's trapped on the island still.<br>
    Not very clever.<br>
    Worst pirate ever,<br>
    It's Booo... Sun... Bill!</p><br>
